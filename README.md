# Image Slide 

An image slider built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to view a series of images in a rotating or sliding format. HTML provides the structure, CSS enhances visual presentation with animations and transitions, while JavaScript adds interactivity such as auto-play, navigation controls, and dynamic image changes, making the slider responsive and engaging across devices.
